Emotions are hard/we're bad at understanding them
so this app can represent their emotions through it, using the power of... Emojis!!!
and, for the funsies, you can see a graph of how often they dislike vs like something

and that's not the only use of it! since we're all teens, and all go through... Points in our lives where we don't feel great(to say the least), you can also use it to see how you feel throughout your life since installing it!
